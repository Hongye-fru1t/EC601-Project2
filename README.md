#tests and results 
#the coding part is searched from web. I tried to understand the all steps. BY reading the assignments, I find some tests parts for google NLP. Some Results look good, but some parts are not good enough to pass the test. 
when I test the English words, the botometer is good to use. It can recognize most mad words which I know. However, if I want to test some Chinese word, as a native Chinese speaker, I know a bouch of words to experise madness. So the test results include some mistakes.
